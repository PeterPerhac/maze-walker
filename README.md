# Maze Walker

Simple 3D maze game with Three.js

[You can play it here](https://devproltd.co.uk/maze-walker/maze-walker.html)

The game looks its best when you play it at night in complete darkness with sound turned up.

If you want to run it locally with dev tools enabled, simply start an HTTP server from the directory where you cloned the game. For example I use python http.server module like so: 

    python -m http.server 8000

The game is a single HTML page with all the code in it. Load the html page in your browser by visiting `http://localhost:8000/maze-walker.html`

[Run around and explore.](https://devproltd.co.uk/maze-walker/maze-walker.html) The goal is to reach the centre of the maze and _interact_ with what you find there. Hint: The portraits scattered around the maze are there to help you.

There's plenty of opportunity to get lost and even if you know the blueprint of the maze, to complete the puzzle is still a lot harder than you'd think.
